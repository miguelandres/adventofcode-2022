# Miguel's Advent of Code 2021

I'm doing this year in Scala, again, I'm using [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
and the [metals extension](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/vscode/) for this repo.

You need to have a JDK 8/11 and scala installed for scalameta to work, if anything I
recommend [installing temurin 11](https://adoptium.net) and then installing scala through
homebrew `brew install scala` (assuming you're on a mac).

After that the project should *just work* on vscode.
